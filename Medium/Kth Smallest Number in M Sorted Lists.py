Problem Statement #
Given ‘M’ sorted arrays, find the K’th smallest number among all the arrays.

Example 1:

Input: L1=[2, 6, 8], L2=[3, 6, 7], L3=[1, 3, 4], K=5
Output: 4
Explanation: The 5th smallest number among all the arrays is 4, this can be verified from the merged 
list of all the arrays: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8]
Example 2:

Input: L1=[5, 8, 9], L2=[1, 7], K=3
Output: 7
Explanation: The 3rd smallest number among all the arrays is 7.


Since we’ll be going through at most ‘K’ elements among all the arrays, and we will remove/add one element in the heap in each step, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(K*logM)O(K∗logM) where ‘M’ is the total number of input arrays.

from heapq import *


def find_Kth_smallest(lists, k):
  minHeap = []

  # put the 1st element of each list in the min heap
  for i in range(len(lists)):
    heappush(minHeap, (lists[i][0], 0, lists[i]))

  # take the smallest(top) element form the min heap, if the running count is equal to k return the number
  numberCount, number = 0, 0
  while minHeap:
    number, i, list = heappop(minHeap)
    numberCount += 1
    if numberCount == k:
      break
    # if the array of the top element has more elements, add the next element to the heap
    if len(list) > i+1:
      heappush(minHeap, (list[i+1], i+1, list))

  return number


def main():
  print("Kth smallest number is: " +
        str(find_Kth_smallest([[2, 6, 8], [3, 6, 7], [1, 3, 4]], 5)))


main()

Problem Statement #
Given ‘M’ sorted arrays, find the K’th smallest number among all the arrays.

Example 1:

Input: L1=[2, 6, 8], L2=[3, 6, 7], L3=[1, 3, 4], K=5
Output: 4
Explanation: The 5th smallest number among all the arrays is 4, this can be verified from the merged 
list of all the arrays: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8]
Example 2:

Input: L1=[5, 8, 9], L2=[1, 7], K=3
Output: 7
Explanation: The 3rd smallest number among all the arrays is 7.


Since we only consider top K elememts of the heap, the time complexity will be O(Log K) and we also scan all the element of all the array so complexity will be O(M)
Overall Complexity will be = O(M Log K)

from heapq import *


def find_Kth_smallest(lists, k):
  minHeap = []

  # put the 1st element of each list in the min heap
  for i in range(len(lists)):
    heappush(minHeap, (lists[i][0], 0, lists[i]))

  # take the smallest(top) element form the min heap, if the running count is equal to k return the number
  numberCount, number = 0, 0
  while minHeap:
    number, i, list = heappop(minHeap)
    numberCount += 1
    if numberCount == k:
      break
    # if the array of the top element has more elements, add the next element to the heap
    if len(list) > i+1:
      heappush(minHeap, (list[i+1], i+1, list))

  return number


def main():
  print("Kth smallest number is: " +
        str(find_Kth_smallest([[2, 6, 8], [3, 6, 7], [1, 3, 4]], 5)))


main()

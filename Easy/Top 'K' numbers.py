***
Given an unsorted array of numbers, find the â€˜Kâ€™ largest numbers in it.

Note: For a detailed discussion about different approaches to solve this problem, take a look at Kth Smallest Number.

Example 1:

Input: [3, 1, 5, 12, 2, 11], K = 3
Output: [5, 12, 11]
Example 2:

Input: [5, 12, 11, -1, 12], K = 3
Output: [12, 11, 12]

  # put first 'K' numbers in the min heap
  for i in range(k):
    heappush(minHeap, nums[i])

  # go through the remaining numbers of the array, if the number from the array is bigger than the
  # top(smallest) number of the min-heap, remove the top number from heap and add the number from array
  for i in range(k, len(nums)):
    if nums[i] > minHeap[0]:
      heappop(minHeap)
      heappush(minHeap, nums[i])

  # the heap has the top 'K' numbers, return them in a list
  return list(minHeap)
